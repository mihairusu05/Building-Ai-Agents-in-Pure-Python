# 🧠 AI Agent Learning Project

Welcome to my AI Agent Learning Project!  
This repository documents my journey into understanding and building AI agents.  
The goal is to explore how autonomous agents can reason, plan, and act based on goals and environments.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers
- Experimenting with agent frameworks and architectures
- Understanding task planning and decision-making
- Building simple autonomous agents to complete real or simulated tasks
- Learning how agents use tools, memory, and feedback loops

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenAI API
- [Add frameworks here, e.g., LangChain, Auto-GPT, etc.]

## 🚧 Status
This is a work-in-progress as I experiment and learn. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
